# Known Issues

This page contains a list of known issues which you may encounter while using
waywall.

## Offset cursor while using fullscreen

If fullscreen is enabled in Minecraft, your mouse cursor may sometimes be offset
from where the game thinks it is. This can be solved by disabling fullscreen.

## Ninjabrain Bot calibration does not work

Ninjabrain Bot's calibration functionality has issues on Linux and does not work
correctly within waywall. Using boat eye largely eliminates the need to
calibrate, but if that is not possible; otherwise, you may need to calibrate
your standard deviation outside of waywall.
