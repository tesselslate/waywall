## Ninjabrain Bot calibration does not work

Ninjabrain Bot's calibration functionality has issues on Linux and does not work
correctly within waywall. Using boat eye largely eliminates the need to
calibrate, but if that is not possible; otherwise, you may need to calibrate
your standard deviation outside of waywall.
